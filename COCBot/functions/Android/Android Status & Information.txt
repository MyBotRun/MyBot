Feature & Functions Notes
-------------------------
DPI Support*: DPI Awareness is available for all Android Emulators, but is different depending on the Android Emulator and background settings and dock mode.
When Android is running in DPI Aware Mode (bot by default is running in DPI un-aware mode) docking and non background mode will turn bot also into DPI Aware
Mode, resulting in smaller Window scaled at 100%. Also, when Android is running in DPI un-aware mode (e.g. iTools), docking will not change anything, only when
disabling background mode.

AndroidSendText*: Works only for ASCII Characters, most symbols, but no Umlauts etc.
It falls back to WinAPI when unsupported characters are detected, but might fail also.
If sending text is not working, keep it empty in bot and last entered text will be sent.

AndroidClick*: Can be only enabled in config.ini, use adb.click.enabled=1 and adb.clicks.enabled=1
