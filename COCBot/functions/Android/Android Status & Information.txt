~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Newer versions of Android Emulators listed here might work.
Android 5 will no longer be supported; SC removed the support.
Additionally we advice to create Android 5.1 instances, not Android 7.1 and up.
The once listed here have been tested and do work.

Known issues/bugs: True Background mode using ADB not available for older 0.x versions.
Older versions might not install the right Clash of Clans APK: "CPU ABI incompatible" error in Play Store.
In that case just install the latest arm-v7a version from apkmirror.com: https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/supercell/clash-of-clans/
ADB connection for BlueStacks2 can require one-time ADB daemon restart (initiated automatically by bot).

Nox
===
http://en.bignox.com/

MyBot Command Line Key: Nox
Default Instance Key: nox
Second Instance Key:  Nox_1

Info/known issues/bugs: Only in low computer screen resolutions and when Android Window doesn't have android screen size of 860x732
due to different window size, MyBot resizing fails for any version. Bot set Nox to fixed size to avoid any resize issues.
Since 3.3.0 Nox support also DirectX that can be used for faster Screen-Capture. Newer versions since 3.7.3 support setting of
framerates and 20 fps or lower significantly reduce CPU load.
Click delays should be 5ms down and 10ms up of clicks get lost.

If you see errors like this "BigNoxVMMgr.exe: error: Code REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG (0x80040154) - Class not registered (extended info not available)"
your Nox installation is corrupt. Then open cmd.exe and register all dlls:
FOR %1 IN ("C:\Program Files\Bignox\BigNoxVM\RT\*.DLL") DO REGSVR32 /S "%1"

Feature & Functions Notes
-------------------------
DPI Support*: DPI Awareness is available for all Android Emulators, but is different depending on the Android Emulator and background settings and dock mode.
When Android is running in DPI Aware Mode (bot by default is running in DPI un-aware mode) docking and non background mode will turn bot also into DPI Aware
Mode, resulting in smaller Window scaled at 100%. Also, when Android is running in DPI un-aware mode (e.g. iTools), docking will not change anything, only when
disabling background mode.

AndroidSendText*: Works only for ASCII Characters, most symbols, but no Umlauts etc.
It falls back to WinAPI when unsupported characters are detected, but might fail also.
If sending text is not working, keep it empty in bot and last entered text will be sent.

AndroidClick*: Can be only enabled in config.ini, use adb.click.enabled=1 and adb.clicks.enabled=1
